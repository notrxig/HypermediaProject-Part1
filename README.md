### Information architecture

I thought that the information needed to be devided in three sections as the wide majority of people do
with their curriculums, the information would be positioned in a similar way as the other ones mainly
because it is better to know where the information is with just a look at it. I thought that it is due 
to being familiar with the type of presentation of information.


First of all, the top part, the most important of them all, because there is where the most important information 
is and because it is the first thing that people see when looking at the first time at the curriculum. 
In this section will be the part where the name and profile picture of this invented person would go. 


After that I thought on dividing the lower part in two other parts, that contain different information in them. 


For the lower left part, the content that would go there would be the contact information and the studies here.


As for the lower right part, I thought of writing the things about him and the laboral experience below it. 


_PS: If you have ever wondered which is the company that this person is supposed to have worked, it is a AMD wannabe._


### Visual design

In the process of making the page, I thought a few ways of doing the project, the first one
was a similar but different one, that would have the different elements like the profile picture
in between two sections mainly because I liked the design but since it would have turned to
be very difficult and the mistrust I have on my programming to turn this design into a web 
page, I made my mind on choosing a easier design that would make the web page easier to code. 

All the designs I had thought about ended having the same three different parts that have the actual
design.

To make the web page have a little nice design I thought on making the columns on the lower part of the document uneven. That being said, I made that the lower left part would be shorter than the lower right part.


As for the color palette, since I could not decide which colors to put and since it is a serious project, 
I thought to myself that the best colors for a project like this would be the ones from a gray scale, 
because they are very neutral, and so it ended like this.
